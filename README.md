### Notes	
- Four Fundamental Principles of OOP :
	- *ABSTRACTION*
	- *ENCAPSULATION*
	- *INHERITANCE*
	- *POLYMORPHISM*
- Check out this [Microsoft Learn tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/oop) for clear definitons

- Inheritance is essential only if : 
	- You are planning to build additional functionality to the Base Class
	- You are NOT redundantly using Base Class functionalities
	- You know the differences between "INHERITANCE" and "ABSTRACTION", i.e., 
		- *ABSTRACTION* : creating an object for using the structure of a Class for desired functionality
		- *INHERITANCE* : building additional structures using the existing structure of the Base Class - without disturbing it - for greater functionality
